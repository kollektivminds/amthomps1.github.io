## A Revolutionary Gospel (Dissertation)
*A Revolutionary Gospel: Secular Transpositions of Orthodox Narrative and the Post-Christian Coming of the New Soviet Person (1905-1917)* [Expected May 2024]

### Summary
This dissertation examines how Maksim Gor'kii and other Russo-Soviet writers attempted to translate the spiritual culture of the Russian Empire into a secular socialist society for the future. Initial success lead him to great prominance among Lenin and other Bolsheviks, but Gor'kii's elaborately crafted "post-Christian" world did not survive entirely intact in Soviet policy. Nevertheless, after an examination of his and others' biblically-inspired literature, in the end *A Revolutionary Gospel* attempts to show how shared narratives are able to steer personal, ethical, and political narratives in society.

### Chapters
1. "Introduction: THe Beginning at the End of the (Old) World"
2. "Chapter 1: Theodicy in the First Decade of Gor'kii's Work"
3. "Chapter 2: Rebuilding God after 1905"
