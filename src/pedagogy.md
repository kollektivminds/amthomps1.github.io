## Background 

I take pride in my educational history at public elementary, secondary, and tertiary educational institutions. My approach to teaching is the product of dozens of public educators' underappreciated sweat and tears from whom I have learned pedagogy and so much more. As the result of many such privileges, a comprehensive and strong liberal-arts education has become both personally and professionally important to me. With all its faults, I stand by our educational system's ability to prepare our future global citizens, critical thinkers, and creative problem-solvers.

## Teaching Philosophy

A Czech proverb nicely summarizes my general approach to language acquisition: “You live a new life for every language you speak; if you know only one language, you live only once.” Inside and outside of the classroom I endeavor to offer students another intellectual life by providing a learning process that is personally relevant and intellectually stimulating. The principles driving my pedagogy emphasize inclusion and belonging in a community of learning that facilitate achievement for the individual and group. In day-to-day practice, this attention on students’ full selves inspires me to celebrate all perspectives and achievement based on individuals' improvement on past performance rather than that of others. I view both language and cultural education as an informal but nonetheless highly important form of diplomacy between nations, and it is a privilege to speak about firsthand experiences with non-native cultures I hold in high regard.
