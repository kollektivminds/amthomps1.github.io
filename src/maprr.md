## MAPRR's Purpose and Key Concepts

From MAPRR's [website](https://maprr.iath.virginia.edu/): "In the cataclysmic nine years from 1914 to 1922, tsarist Russia disappeared from the map, fragmenting into regions, cities, and villages as an entire empire split into battle zones. This website helps us capture a shifting sense of self and attachment to a place through a database more than 600 poems and short prose composed during these war years by 70 writers."

MAPRR describe self and place through "place-based concepts" (PBCs) that describe the relationship between our emotions, identities, and how we see the world around us.Its subject is the writings of Russian poets, essays, and dramatists, many of whom are largely unknown ourside of the project. MAPRR offers novel tools to explore how famous and everyday Russians experienced their home country and cities change drastically over the period of the First World War and Russian Civil War. Of special note is the analytical graphs, which represent in a visual and interactive medium the connections between PBCs, historical people, geographic locations and the literary culture of the time. Select works are provided in English.
